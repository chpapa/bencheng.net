Just came across this old photo of my room 6 years ago…. I was using Mandrake on AMD CPU computer
and Windows XP on a Dell Notebook. And… something I don’t remember already…

* I just remembered I used a small notebook in my pocket extensively, but don’t recall that I have those small memo with “todo” written down….
* I used that hubs for networking???
* I’ve got a Borland C++ Builder box on the right-hand side…. ah! Once I was using C++ a lot for freelance jobs, but then I fall-in-love with all those dynamic languages. :-)
* My desk is very messy… anyway I was a kid, ok?
