My day job is running [SkyMakers Digital](https://www.skymakers.digital/), with teams in Hong Kong,
Taipei, London and Canada. I live mostly in Taipei and Hong Kong.

We are driven by developers and technologies, value craftsmanship, and socially progressive.

Our mission is to build open source solutions to help corporate in digital transformation and help developers build secure and privacy-aware software.

We have 3 business units:

### Oursky

[Oursky](https://www.oursky.com) develop exceptional digital products worldwide, offering top-notch user interface and user experience (UI/UX) design, agile software development, machine learning and data engineering, QA as a Service, and product management services. Our clients range from dynamic startups to global entities such as HSBC and Nvidia.

### Authgear

[Authgear](https://authgear.com) is an open-source Identity & User Management solution for web and mobile applications. We want to empower users with better security, such as Passkeys, TOTP 2FA, and session management, in every software they use, by making these security features dead simple for developers so they don't get sacrificed due to lack of knowledge, budget, or time.

### FormX
[FormX.ai](https://formx.ai) uses AI to automatically extract crucial information from your documents. This empowers businesses to streamline workflows and automate processes. Our platform simplifies the creation of custom data extractors for various document types. Furthermore, our AI models continuously learn from real-world examples, ensuring increasing accuracy over time. 

### Beyond my day job

I served as various non-profit related to the freedom, democracy, security & privacy of the
Internet, such as Internet Society Hong Kong, Culture & Media Education Foundation, Creative
Commons, etc.
